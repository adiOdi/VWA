This thesis describes and definies artificial intelligence, and what it makes possible. 

It will differentiate between the different families of AI, namely the differentiation between symbolic and subsymbolic AI, the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, and the specialities of parameterless AI.

It will also demonstrate these differences with appropriate examples, such as decision trees, neural nets, Q-Tables and support vector machines.
