\chapter{What is AI?}

Defining AI is quite hard, but according to \cite{russellArtificialIntelligenceModern2010}, artificial intelligence can be defined very broadly, and as every agent acting on an environment intelligently.\\An Agent is defined as an entity being able to perceive inputs, and act according to its percept sequence.\\ An environment can be almost everything: e.g. a website, the real world, or something abstract like a map.\\ So in contrast to common belief, AI isn't just machine learning and node networks, but rather a much bigger field, containing many subfields.
