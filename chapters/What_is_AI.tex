\chapter{What is AI?}

\section{Definition}{ Defining AI is quite hard, but according to \cite{russellArtificialIntelligenceModern2010}, artificial intelligence can be defined very broadly, and as every agent acting on an environment intelligently, and rationally.

An Agent is defined as an entity being able to perceive inputs, and act according to its percept sequence.\\ 
An environment can be almost everything: e.g. a website, the real world, or something abstract like a map.\\ 
So in contrast to common belief, AI isn't just machine learning and node networks, but rather a much bigger field, containing many subfields.}
\section{Functions}{ One might ask why neural nets are this fitting for the task,  The general challenge in this field is finding a function to map these percept sequences to actions the agent can take. \\ 
A possible method for this are neural nets, which can be described as complex functions. Actually there are many more possible functions, which all are possible, but as there are very practical advantages, discussed in a further chapter, neural nets are quite interesting.}
\section{Humans}{
One way to create AI is to try to mimic Humans, after all, according to \cite[page 6]{russellArtificialIntelligenceModern2010}, Humans and animals are nothing more than machines, so we might be able to build such thinking machines ourselves as well.
