\chapter{what is ai?}

Defining AI is quite hard, but according to \cite{russellArtificialIntelligenceModern2010}, artificial intelligence can be defined very broadly, and as every agent acting on an environment.\\An Agent is defined as an entety being able to percieve inputs, and acting accordding to its percept sequence. An environment can be almost everything: e.g. a website, the real world, or something abstract like a map.\\ So in contrast to common belief, AI isn't just machine learning and node networks, but rather a much bigger field, containing many subfields.
