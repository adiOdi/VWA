\chapter{Introduction}
\paragraph{Why is this topic important?}
In the last few years, AI has been the topic of many discussions, even through many do not really understand what Artificial Intelligence is.
Even the Author himself needed to figure some things out first, as he started to write this work.\\
While many see AI as these super-strong real-life robots, many do not get just how broad one can define intelligent agents, and just how close it is to all of our lives, even through we are currently not using as versatile agents, as Hollywood would like us to believe.\\
The most obvious examples of use of AI are found around computers, more closely around social media, and almost everywhere “Algorithms” are used, for example to help advertisers advertise \cite{facebookWerbungAufInstagram} or to sort content \cite{googleFunktioniertGoogleSucheSuchalgorithmen}.
\paragraph{Questions this thesis seeks to answer:}
The Author wants to bring this topic in broader view of the public, and wants to answer the questions of... 
\begin{itemize}
    \item whether AI is just a tool
    \item whether you can call an intelligent agent a tool
    \item what previously impossible to solve tasks can be solved using AI
    \item what new problems arise
    \item what effect the use of AI has on society
    \item how AI should be used
\end{itemize}
Maybe the author will focus on “aligned” and “save” AI as well.
\paragraph{How was this thesis made?}
Having read through the Introduction of the book “Artificial Intelligence, an Introduction” \cite{russellArtificialIntelligenceModern2010}, the author would like to answer these (and more) questions using mainly this book, using other works to back it up in very specific topics not discussed as extensively in this book.\\
The Author would like to start by means of an overview about intelligent agents, followed by a chapter concerning the current and further use of AI in our everyday life.
