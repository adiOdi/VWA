In the last few years, AI has been the topic of many discussions, even through many do not really understand what Artificial Intelligence is. 
Even the Author himself needed to figure some things out first, as he started to write this work. \\
The Author wants to bring this topic in broader view of the public, and wants to answer the questions of wether AI is just a tool, wether you can call an intelligent agent a tool, what previously impossible to solve tasks someone can solve using AI, and what new problems arise.\\
While many see AI as these super-strong real-life robots, many do not get just how broad one can define intelligent agents, and just how close it is to all of our lives, even through we are currently not using as versatile agents, as Hollywood would like us to believe.\\
Having read through the Introduction of the book "Artificial Intelligence, an Introduction", I would like to answer these (and more) questions using mainly this book.\\
Another question Concerning AI would be the question of effect, AI has on us and our society, and how we should use it. Maybe I will set a focus on save AI as well.\\
