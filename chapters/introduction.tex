\chapter{Introduction}
% Motivation, warum ich, warum dieses Thema
This thesis was written as a VWA.

I chose this topic, as I am very interested in the topic of artificial intelligence, and wanted to use the possibility of investing more time into a topic to learn more about it.

% =Abstract, aber genauer, kann referenzieren
I will start by exploring what AI actually means, and where we use it. Then I move on to give a few examples of possible architectures and algorithms to implement AI. Finally, I introduce a few possibilities of categorizing the field of AI, and classify the previously given examples.
