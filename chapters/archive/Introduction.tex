\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Why is this topic important?}
In the last few years, AI has been the topic of many discussions, often without a realistic view on AI.

While many see AI as these super-strong real-life robots, many do not get just how broad one can define AI in a sense of intelligent agents, and just how close it is to all of our lives, even through we are currently not using as versatile agents, as Hollywood would like us to believe.

The most obvious examples of use of AI are found around computers, more closely around social media, and almost everywhere those mysterious “Algorithms” are used, for example to help advertisers advertise \cite{facebookWerbungAufInstagram} or to sort content \cite{googleFunktioniertGoogleSucheSuchalgorithmen}.
\section{Questions this thesis seeks to answer:}
The Author wants to bring this topic in broader view of the public, and wants to answer the questions of: 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item What AI is (in an abstract sense).
%     \item How AI affects society.
%     \item What previously impossible to solve tasks AI can help to solve.
%     \item What new problems arise.
%     \item How we can build aligned and save AI, to help mitigate those problems.
% \end{itemize}
\section{How was this thesis made?}
Using mainly content found in the book “Artificial Intelligence, an Introduction” \cite{russellArtificialIntelligenceModern2010}, the author would like to answer these questions, using other works to back it up in specific topics not discussed as extensively in this book. This is possible as Modern approach is quite extensive, and covers most of the topics discussed in this thesis.
