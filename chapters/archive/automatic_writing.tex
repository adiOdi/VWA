What is AI?
Where do we use it?
Online: Algorithms, Social media, it's easier online as it is completely deterministic, more or less, humans make this hard, but like in games, instead of reality, the simulated world is easier to navigate.
the importance of algorithms in our society is high enough, that we start moving towards the world of the algorithms, as before the algorithms tried implementing into our world of chaos. 
this is like the story of rhe prophet, where the mountain comes to him, relative motion, rather than absolute Motion is the key here, and we are getting closer, and more integrated, which, in a sense, is good, as we get closer to the efficiency-level of computers, but also not as good, as we get the determinism of computers al well, and the calculatability, which makes us less free in our wills in a sense.
there's also the problem of trust, as we tend to trust persons more than some computer, some can't even start to comprehend the inner workings of, with a humen, one can at least somehow relate.
Wheter we can and should trust humans is to be decided, but trusting a thing only a part of society understands, can be problematic, as it might lead to a two-class system, of those who do, and those who don't understand a system. And when these systems really decide important stuff, this gets complicated.
