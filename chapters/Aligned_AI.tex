\chapter{Aligned AI}

\section{What is that?}
Aligned AI would be an AI having the same values as humans would have, and act accordingly. The topic of aligned AI is a very high-level one, mostly not bothering about the technical implementation.
\section{Problem}
But therein lies the first problem: What can we say are values, humans have? Some values we, as a species, can agree on, but in most topics there are at least two opposing opinions. To formalize valid rules and values to AI, we would first have to “solve” important philosophical questions, and as we haven't until now, we will have to live with AI's at most being aligned with a group of people.
\section{Importance}
The importance of aligning AI cannot be stressed enough, as aligned AI is vital for the safety of such an AI.
