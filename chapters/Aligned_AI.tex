\chapter{Aligned AI}

\section{What is aligned AI}
Aligned AI would be an AI having the same values as humans would have, and act accordingly. The topic of aligned AI is a high-level one, mostly not bothering about the technical implementation.
\section{Problems that arise when trying to implement aligned AI}
But therein lies the first problem: What can we say are values, humans have? Some values we, as a species, can agree on, but in most topics there are at least two opposing opinions. To formalize valid rules and values to AI, we would first have to “solve” important philosophical questions, and as we haven't until now, we will have to live with AI's at most being aligned with a group of people.
\section{Importance of implementing aligned AI}
The importance of aligning AI cannot be stressed enough, as aligned AI is vital for the safety of any AI.
