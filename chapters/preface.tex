A big thank you to:

Manuel Menzinger, my tutor, who helped me get through this whole VWA, and was the one who sparked my interest in the topic.

My Dad, who helped me get my things in line for the endspurt.

My Mom, who got me working, when there was still enough time.

My English teachers, as writing a thesis in this field without English is nearly impossible.

The same counts for Maths as well.

The programmers of the amazing (when it works) software I am able to use for free.
