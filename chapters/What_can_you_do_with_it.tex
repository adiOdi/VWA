There are many use cases for AI, but the ones AI is used in most are very repetitive tasks with loads of data, as those are harder to grasp for humans. As with any tool, one can use AI in both malicious and well-meant applications.
\section{Usage for malice}
Applications for individual benefit of (mostly companies) include (but are not limited to) Facebook \cite{facebookWerbungAufInstagram} and \cite{googleOnlinewerbungLeichtGemacht}, both companies using AI for advertisements, and not benefiting the end-user.
\section{Usage for the good of everyone}
Other use cases through, are benefiting more of the ones using the service. The author, for example, would put google's search-algorithm \cite{googleFunktioniertGoogleSucheSuchalgorithmen} into this category, as it not only makes searching the web faster, but actually enables it, as without a usable search-algorithm using the web as we are now would be impossible.
